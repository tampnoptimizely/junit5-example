Why create anchor links to jump to a specific part of the page?
Even though creating anchor links adds a few more steps to your process before publishing a blog post, it can make a big impact on user experience.

Anchor links can be used to create features like table of contents, which can enhance the organization of long blog posts.

Creating links that take you to a specific part of the page makes it much easier for users to navigate through your content and find the information they are looking for. Without the assistance of anchor links, users may end up scrolling through the page for a long time, which could lead them to bounce.

Ultimately, your customers will appreciate skimmable, easy-to-read content and may be more likely to revisit your site or make a purchase because of it.
